# Introduction

Changes in the communty of diatoms in response to several environmental factors have been well studied. Thereby, changes in diatom community structure  can be taken as a proxy for environmental pollution with e.g. nutrients. However, the response of the diatom community to pesticides has not been well studied so far. Especially the response to herbicides is of special concern since they are the type of herbicides that are most toxic to diatoms. 

In this study, monitoring data from lotic waterbodies in Germany from the years 2005 - 2012 is used to perform Correspondance Analysis (CA). With ordination via CA, the main trend of variation can be visualized. With subsequent Canonical Correspondance Analysis (CCA), this trend can be connected to environmental descriptors. Those environmental descriptors are represented by a dataset of physical-chemical data and herbicide data sampled in lotic waterbodies of Germany as well.

# Keep all rows that have a EC50 value or that are no pesticides.

phch_sam = phch_sam %>%
  filter(!ec50f_al4896_fin=="" | psm == FALSE)

nrow(phch_sam) #5113250

```


## Data preparation

For the CCA later on, a dataset was created containing only diatom samples where herbicides were measured at the same site in the same month (`dia_sam_cca`). For the CA, all samples were retained in order to have a larger dataset  (`dia_sam`).

```{r join-on-site-year, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# Diatom data

dia_sam_cca <- semi_join(dia_sam, phch_sam[phch_sam$psm==TRUE & !phch_sam$value_fin == 0,], by = c("site_id", "month"))
nrow(dia_sam_cca) # 37415

##AS: like this you can keep it an sf-object:
##AS: generally you can handle sf-Objects with dplyr like data.frames and tibbles
#dia_sites_cca <- dia_sites_geo[ dia_sites_geo$site_id %in% psm_sites_geo$site_id, ]
```


### Usage of cover data as quantitative variable
In most cases, diatom cover was measured instead of abundance. Therefore, rows where abundance was measured were deleted. Instead, the cover data is used as the quantitative variable in the following analyses. The deletion of irrelevant rows was performed for the datasets for CA and CCA seperately.

```{r delete-abundance-data, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
dia_sam <- dia_sam[!is.na(dia_sam$cover), ]
dia_sam <- dia_sam[,-6]    #delete column with abundance data

dia_sam_cca <- dia_sam_cca[!is.na(dia_sam_cca$cover), ]
dia_sam_cca <- dia_sam_cca[,-6] 
```

It seems like the distribution of samples and sampling events is very similar. This means that on every sampling day and event, a similar number of samples was taken. 

One month of the early and the late application season, respectively, were to be chosen for further analysis. Even though most samples were available for the month August, to compare July and September seemed more suitable. 

```{r herbicides-sampling-overview, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
psm_count_ym = phch_sam %>%
  filter(psm == TRUE) %>%
  group_by(year, month) %>%
  summarise(N = n()) %>%
   as.data.frame()

psm_gg1 <- ggplot(phch_sam[phch_sam$psm==TRUE,], aes(x=month)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title="herbicide samples per month", x = "month", y = "number of samples")
psm_gg1
ggsave(psm_gg1, width = 4, height = 4, filename = "figures/n_psm_month.png")

psm_gg2<- ggplot(psm_count_ym, aes(y = N, x = year)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap( ~ month) +
  ggtitle ("number of herbicide samples per year and month")
psm_gg2
ggsave(psm_gg2, width = 10, height = 10, filename = "figures/n_psm_my.png")

psm_gg3 <- ggplot(phch_sam[phch_sam$psm==TRUE,], aes(x=year)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title="herbicide samples per year", x = "year", y = "sample counts")
psm_gg3
```

Herbicides were sampled in all month with a high intensity. Generally, less samples were taken in the winter months. According to this continuous high amount of data, no months have to be excluded based on that. The amount of diatom data would be the more conservative proxy to gudge which months are appropriate to use for further analyses.
In 2015, almost no herbicide samples were taken. Also, the year 2014 was not so frequently sampled.

```{r remove-months}
dia_sam = dia_sam %>%
  filter(month %in% c("07",  "09"))

dia_sam_cca = dia_sam_cca %>%
  filter(month %in% c("07", "09"))
  
```

## Taxon frequency
[@Marchant.2002] suggests to remove rare species as only common species produce information that can reliably be linked to present environmental gradients. [@Cao.2001] suggests the removal of rare species if samples were taken over a large spatial scale which holds true for the present dataset. Furthermore, Chi-square distance, which is the distance measure used in CA and CCA, gives more weight to rare species. Due to this reason, (@Legendre.2012) suggest to remove rare species from the analysis. Here, 4 datasets are created: Species and genera that occur at less than 20 % of the sites were removed, respectively and species and genera that occur in less than 5 % of the samples were removed, respectively (@Fernandez.2016).

The analysis was done for both, species and genus data and therefore, all procedures were performed for species data and genus data seperately from here on. According to (@Rimet.2012), analysis with a taxonomic resolution of genus performs as well as a resolution of species level in many cases. Similarly, (@Larras.2014) found that diatom sensitivity to herbicides can be attributed to their phylogeny. They reported that centric and araphid diatoms (Thalassiosirales and Fragilariales, respectively
) were most sensitive to the herbicides whereas pennates (Cymbellales, Naviculales and Bacillariales)
) were more robust.

## Transform data to get from long to wide data

For the subsequent analysis, the data needed to be transformend from long to wide format. If several combinations of (`site_id`)  and (`species`) were present, the 95th percentile was taken to aggregate them. Further, the first column was stored as rowname. The aggregation was first performed over all years and over all months seperately.

#### graphical inspection of years
```{r ggplot-year}
# overview plots

length(unique(dia_sam$site_id)) ##AS: 1194

gr1 = ggplot(dia_sam, aes(y = site_id, x = month)) +
  geom_raster(aes(fill = year)) +
  facet_wrap( ~ year)
gr1

ggsave(gr1, width = 8, height = 5, filename = '/tmp/dia_sam.png')

gr2 = ggplot(dia_cov, aes(y = site_id, x = year)) +
  geom_raster(aes(fill = log10(cover+1)))
gr2
##AS: Maybe skip 2013/14?

gr3 = ggplot(dia_cov) +
  geom_raster(aes(y = site_id, x = day, fill = year))
gr3
```

### Aggregation per month

The data were aggregated per month by the 95th percentile of the cover. The data were then transformed from long to wide format.

Diatom communities follow a seasonal succession which might be more prominent than the interanual succession. (@Hausmann.2007) showed that for lakes, the spring and summer conditions had a strong impact on the diatom composition and productivity that was stronger than the impact of changing annual mean temperatures. Similarly,  (@Kirilova.2008) observed a seasonal succession of diatoms in  lakes. The predominant diatoms in winter and spring were of the genus *Stephanodiscus* while species of the genera *Stephanodiscus*, *Fragilaria*, and *Nitzschia* were the most abundant diatoms in summer and autumn. To account for this seasonal variability of diatom composition, it seemed reasonable to summarize the diatom data for each month over all years.
 
#### Species

### DCA

A Detrended Correspondance Analysis (DCA) was performed in order to decide whether it is appropriate to conduct a unimodal gradient method. DCA was introduced by (@Hill.1980). If the length of the first DCA axis, scaled in units of standard deviations (S.D.), is > 4 S.D. a complete species turnover can be assumed and a unimodal gradient method is appropriate to use. A linear gradient method would be more appropriate for a length of the first axes < 3 S.D., indicating an incomplete change of species composition. For an axis length between 3 and 4, both types of methods are appropriate to use (@Leps.2003).

#### Species

```{r dca-species, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
lapply(cast_sp, function(x) {decorana(x)})
lapply(cast_sp, function(x) {plot(decorana(x), display="both")})
```
The legth of the first axis is > 3 S.D. in all months and therefore, a unimodal gradient can be assumed for all months.

#### Genus
```{r dca-genus, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
lapply(cast_ge, function(x) {decorana(x)})
lapply(cast_ge, function(x) {plot(decorana(x), display="both")})
```

Also for genus data, the length of the first axis is > 3 S.D. in all months and therefore, a unimodal gradient can be assumed for all months.

#### Genus - CCA
```{r dca-genus-cca-dataset, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
lapply(cast_ge_cca, function(x) {decorana(x)})
lapply(cast_ge_cca, function(x) {plot(decorana(x), display="both")})
```

For genus data for the cca, the length of the first axis is > 4 S.D. in all months and therefore, a unimodal gradient can be assumed for all months.

## CA

Correspondance Analysis (CA) was used to determine the major trends of variation of the diatom community before including any environmental data. CA is an ordination method and hence reduces data of multidimensional space to a 2- or 3-dimensional representation with minimal loss of information. The dimensions included in the ordination plot are the ones with the highest amount of variance and thus display the greatest part of variability of the data. The advantage of CA is that, by using weighted averages ordination, sites and species are ordered at the same time into the same space. In the ordination plot, similar communities and species are close together while dissimilar communities and species are further apart.

### Species

```{r  ca-species, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# conduct CA
ca_sp <-lapply(cast_sp, function(x) {cca(x)})

# Compute summary of CA results to inspect proportion of variance explained by each axis.
lapply(ca_sp, function(x) {summary(x)})
```

```{r  plot-ca-species, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# Compute biplots without names
lapply(cast_sp, function(x) {plot(cca(x), scaling=2)})

# Biplots with species names
dianame_long_sp <- lapply(cast_sp, function(x) colnames(x))

dianame_sp <- lapply(cast_sp, function(x) make.cepnames(names(x)))
stems_sp <- lapply(cast_sp, colSums)

for (i in 1:length(dianame_sp)) {
  plot(ca_sp[[i]], dis="sp", type="n") #red crosses = species, dots = sites
  orditorp(ca_sp[[i]], dis="sp", lab=dianame_sp[[i]], priority=stems_sp[[i]],
           pcol="red", pch="+")
}
```
It seems like there are not one or two main factors explaining the variance in diatom composition but many since the fraction of cumulative explained variation is also not very high when considering several axes.
I.e.
July: cum explained variance of 1.+2. axes:0.12000
August: cum explained variance of 1.+2. axes: 0.09192
September: cum explained variance of 1. + 2. axes: 0.11570

### Genus

```{r  ca-genus, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# conduct CA
ca_ge <-lapply(cast_ge, function(x) {cca(x)})

# Compute summary of CA results to inspect proportion of variance explained by each axis.
lapply(ca_ge, function(x) {summary(x)})
```

The cumulated explained variance of the first two axes is above 20 % in all months which is a much higher value than when taking species for the CA. Therefore, it might make more sense to proceed analysis with genus data instead of with species data.
I.e.: 
July: 1.+2. CA: 19.9 % of cumulative explaned variance
August: 1.+2. CA: 19.8 % of cumulative explaned variance
September:  1.+2. CA: 23.5 % of cumulative explaned variance

```{r  plot-ca-genus, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# Compute biplots without names
lapply(cast_ge, function(x) {plot(cca(x), scaling=2)})

# Biplots with species names
dianame_long_ge <- lapply(cast_ge, function(x) colnames(x))

# dianame_m_ge <- lapply(cast_months_ge, function(x) make.cepnames(names(x)))
stems_ge <- lapply(cast_ge, colSums)

for (i in 1:length(dianame_long_ge)) {
  plot(ca_ge[[i]], dis="sp", type="n") #red crosses = species, dots = sites
  orditorp(ca_ge[[i]], dis="sp", lab=dianame_long_ge[[i]], priority=stems_ge[[i]],
           pcol="red", pch="+")
}

```

Does not work yet
```{r}
# make plots
ca_list_ge = list()
for (i in 1:length(dianame_long_ge)) {
 p = plot(ca_ge[[i]], dis="sp", type="n") 
  orditorp(ca_ge[[i]], dis="sp", lab=dianame_long_ge[[i]], priority=stems_ge[[i]],
           pcol="red", pch="+")
  ca_list_ge[[i]] = p
}

# save plots
for (i in 1:3) {
  file_name = paste("ca_plot_ge_", i, ".png", sep="")
  png(file_name)
  print(ca_list_ge[[i]])
  dev.off()
}
```

## Environmental data

`cast_ge_cca`is the diatom data to use for this part.

All physical-chemical data were deleted that were not taken at the same site and in the same month as a diatom sample.
